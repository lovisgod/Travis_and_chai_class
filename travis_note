Continuous Integration is the continuous practice of merging in small code changes frequently - rather than merging in a large change at the end of a development cycle. The goal is to build healthier software by developing and testing in smaller increments. This is where Travis CI comes in.

Travis is a CI service which simply means it an automated process. A typical workflow with Travis ad GitHub goes like this:

* A commit is pushed to GitHub

* Travis build is triggered and it checks if the test is passing or failing.

Travis CI makes developing software efficient. it ensures you deploy clean code that follows good practice and also detects if there are possible bugs or deficit in your code caused by a change or refactor in your project.

Following the TDD process, a developer must focus on the test cases before actually coding anything. That meansa developer is thinking more about the use of the software and the design of user interfaces to achieve that. As a result, the developer is more interested in the interface than in the implementationâ€”and that leads to more usable software.
